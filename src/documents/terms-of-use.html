  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>VI. Our services – Neutral venue<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>We are not a transport service provider, freight forwarder or broker of any sort. The website acts as a neutral venue through which shippers and carriers can meet and enter into negotiations with the intention to enter into transactions. We are in no way involved in the actual transport and related services. We have no control over the quality, safety, or legal aspects of the transport services and/or transactions that take place through the website.</p>
    <p>Didrok functions solely as a neutral venue and digital clearinghouse where two parties may agree on a price for a particular type of service. Didrok is the neutral venue for this connection between you and other users. Didrok does not provide any endorsement for you or your services, you acknowledge and agree that Didrok does not provide the transport and related services and Didrok is not in any way responsible for assisting you in any manner with your provision of the transport and related services. Didrok cannot and will not guarantee the ability of users to complete payment for any of the provided services. Your contract in connection with a transaction will be with the other user and, as a result, Didrok can give no commitments of any nature about the other user or the transport and related services, whether as for example, but not limited to, quality, quantity, delivery or price.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, due to the difficulty of authentication, especially on the Internet, Didrok cannot and will not in any manner verify or confirm the identity, profile of users, or ability of users to pay for the provided services.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that any and all communications, correspondence, verbal or written, or any warranties or representations, made with regard to the services are not provided by Didrok and are specifically and solely between you and the other user. Because Didrok is not involved in the actual transaction between shippers and carriers, Didrok has no control over the accuracy of listings, the ability of the carriers to transport items, or the ability of shippers to send items. Didrok cannot ensure that a shipper or a carrier will actually complete a transport.</p>
    <p>If you are a carrier, you hereby agree that the website is for transport related services only and that the work that you provide will only involve services. You agree that you will not use Didrok to market or sell any goods or products or other services unrelated to the transport, unless specifically allowed by Didrok.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the shipper to select a suitable carrier for the provision of the transport and the responsibility of the shipper and the carrier to negotiate the terms of the transaction.</p>
    <p>Didrok is in no way involved in payment for the transport and related services and is not responsible for any monetary disputes that reside with a carrier or a shipper; it is the responsibility of both the carrier and the shipper to resolve all monetary disputes, damage claims, breach of contract claims, etc. outside of Didrok.</p>
    <p>Save where expressly stated otherwise in the Terms, and only to the extent so stated, no provision of the Terms shall give rise to any legal contracts, liabilities, obligations, claims or other benefits or protection between users or in favor of third parties.</p></p>

  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>VII. Prohibited and restricted items<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>Prohibited items: Hazardous goods that cannot be shipped through the mail or commercial transport service providers are not allowed on Didrok. Hazardous materials that lawfully may be transported under certain conditions (if they are properly packaged and labeled) may be listed on Didrok – provided that the listing contains a clear notice of the hazardous nature of the material and a description of the planned method of shipping that complies with the law.</p>
    <p>Restricted items: Generally, restricted or perishable items that can lawfully be transported by mail or commercial transport service providers are permitted on Didrok.</p>
    <p>Full responsibility rests with the shipper to comply with all postal and non-postal laws and regulations that relate to the mailing of hazardous, restricted and perishable material. Anyone who sends, or causes to be sent, a non-mailable or improperly packaged hazardous material can be subject to severe regulatory or indeed criminal penalties.</p></p>

  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>VIII. Quotes<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>Carriers must be legally allowed to transport the shipments they quote on. Carriers agree that it is their sole obligation to comply with all laws, rules, statutes and regulations that may apply including any and all local, state, federal and/or national licensing requirements. You acknowledge that by providing your quote on our website you accept the terms of services described in the request for quote by the shipper. You acknowledge that the Didrok website exists for shippers to make a fully informed decision about your quotes, service offering, policies and procedures. Therefore, you shall only quote services which you are capable of providing, complying with all requirements in the request for quote indicated by the shipper. You acknowledge that your quote includes all and any charges related to all the requested services, excluding VAT. In the event, that you charge &#8220;extra fees&#8221; beyond and/or above your quote agreed by the shipper by assigning the transport order to you (non-foreseeable costs related to customs clearance, demurrage, extra pick-up and/or delivery, cleaning and waste costs (these latter two only in case of bulk transport) are not included), Didrok reserves the right to suspend or cancel your account at Didrok’s sole discretion. If you quote on any shipment and your quote is accepted by the shipper, you are obligated to perform the services described in the request for quote you quoted on at the price you quoted. You authorize Didrok to charge your account balance in Didrok with the charges for quoting and, in case the shipper assigns a transport order to you, for allocation of the transport order.</p></p>

<div class="toggle">
  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>IX. Shipping<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>Unless otherwise stated, shipments are understood as being duly packaged for transport.</p>
    <p>Shippers are obliged to complete the requested and specified transport service with the carrier the transport order has been assigned to, unless the transaction is prohibited by law or by these Terms. By quoting on a request for quote, the carrier agrees to be bound by the conditions included in the request for quote and the transport order so long as those details are not unlawful or in violation of these Terms.</p>
    <p>By assigning the transport order to the carrier the shipper agrees to be bound by the conditions included in the request for quote and the transport order so long as those details are not unlawful or in violation of these Terms.</p>
    <p>The carrier reserves the right to inspect your shipment before accepting it, and to refuse to transport any item prohibited by law or by these Terms. Didrok recommends that you do not seal any shipment before inspection by the carrier.</p>
    <p>Didrok screens shippers and carriers against a set of restricted party listings and requires a copy of the valid transport operator’s license and insurance of carriers. However, Didrok does not screen for compliance with national, federal, state or local laws and regulations.</p></p>

<div class="toggle">
  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>X. Charges<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>Didrok does not charge any access fee, setup fee, maintenance fee or membership fee to any company or user.</p>
    <p>Creation and sending of requests for quote and of transport orders is free. Only carriers are charged, always as a % of the quote submitted by them, when sending quotes and receiving transport orders.</p>
    <p>The charge for quoting is 0.05% of the submitted quote and it is charged to any carrier sending a quote. The charge for quoting is charged at the time of quoting.</p>
    <p>The charge for allocation of a transport order is 0.5% of the submitted quote and it is charged only to the carrier that is selected by the shipper to carry out the transport. The charge for allocation of a transport order is calculated at the time of quoting but is charged at the time of the transport order allocation.</p>
    <p>In case the carrier’s available account balance is insufficient to cover charges, the carrier is not allowed to either quote or being assigned a transport order until an appropriate top-up of the balance.</p>
    <p>Above charges incurred are independent of the actual performance of the transport. Subject to clause X., the obligation to pay the charges therefore still applies if a request for quote is cancelled or the transport order is assigned but is not subsequently carried out and/or the transaction is later terminated. Didrok may waive the related charges as a gesture of goodwill; however the granting of any such waiver is entirely within Didrok’s sole discretion and if so granted is always without accepting any legal obligation to do so. Didrok’s decision is final.</p>
    <p>Didrok reserves the right to waive or change the basis for the calculation of the fees at any time. Didrok may also temporarily change or suspend the fees for a promotional period. Any such changes will be described on the website.</p>
    <p>Carriers are responsible for collecting payment for the transport and related services themselves, as agreed with the shipper previously.</p></p>

<div class="toggle">
  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>XI. Payment for Didrok’s services<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>At the creation of each carrier’s company account an account balance is created into which credits are paid by the carrier and from which the applicable charges are deducted by Didrok in accordance with clause X.</p>
    <p>Charges for quoting and allocation of transport orders are shown in the user’s preferred currency.</p>
    <p>Carriers may credit their Didrok account in the currency of their choice. Said Didrok account will be credited with the converted amount in EUR, based on the daily exchange rate of the European Central Bank (as displayed on <a href="http://www.ecb.eu" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ecb.eu']);">www.ecb.eu</a>) on the day of the transaction.</p>
    <p>The Didrok account balance is a virtual representation of the credit available to pay for above charges. This Didrok account balance is only valid in <a href="http://www.didrok.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.didrok.com']);">www.didrok.com</a> or <a href="http://www.freightforge.com" >www.freightforge.com</a> and does not constitute a valid legal tender. Didrok does not pay any interest on the carrier’s account balance.</p>
    <p>The Didrok account balance can be topped up by credit card payment, using Visa, Visa Electron, MasterCard or Maestro. Eventual transfer and exchange expenses shall be borne exclusively by the carrier.</p>
    <p>The minimum amount an account balance can be topped up with at any time is the equivalent of 10 EUR. There is no maximum when topping up the account balance. The amount credited to the account is shortly available after top-up. The carrier’s account balance is always visible in the account, showing the current balance.</p>
    <p>Didrok reserves the right to deactivate accounts with no activity for a period of more than 6 months. In such cases any available credits in the account are lost and will not be reimbursed.</p>
    <p>Invoices for the credit card payments of carriers are available in the carrier’s company account in the form of e-invoices, and can be downloaded in .pdf format. By using Didrok, carriers accept the e-invoices and e-invoicing as the only invoicing method from Didrok.</p></p>

<div class="toggle">
  <h4 class="toggle-title"><i class='icon-star'></i>XII. Cancellation, refund<span></span></h4>
  <div class="toggle-inner">
    <p>As a rule, in case the carrier cancels its quote or does not perform the requested and agreed transport and/or related services, the related Didrok charges are not refunded in any case.</p>
    <p>Didrok takes the abuse of the procedure of refunding very seriously. Abuse includes attempting to cancel matches that have already occurred or are expected to occur, or colluding with other users to abuse the procedure. If a user is found abusing or is suspected of abusing the procedure, his company and/or user account maybe immediately suspended or terminated at Didrok’s sole discretion.</p></p>
